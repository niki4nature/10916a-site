      Team 10916a is looking for sponsors to fund for certain equipment and parts. Parents are alredy spending a lot of their time on VEX and then have to spend a lot of money on parts. Having a lot of parts is useful, as if we run out, we wouldnt need to break any thing down.

       We would specifically like to use funding to have a school field. We will add your logo on our team t-shirts, banners, robots for various tournaments(regionals, states, worlds) depending of the amount of help we recieve. We would be willing to hand out company branded swag.
